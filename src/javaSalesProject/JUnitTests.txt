JUnit tests for the Java Sales Project

Test for Log in method - Creating new Customer:
	- Ensures that we can create a new customer account. The variables/objects involved are the string 
	  username and the string password which represent the username and password respectively.
	- If we successfully create a new account it will print "The new account has been created" 
	  and it will overwrite the currentUser field in the driver as well as add the new user to the arraylist of accounts; therefore showing the code works.
	- The only ways to make the code fail is to input:
		a) A username that is the same as another accounts username
		b) A username that contains an illegal character EX: a "|" 
		c) A password that contains an illegal character EX: a "|"


Test for Log in method - Logging in as existing Customer:
	- Ensures that we can log in to an existing customer account. The variables/objects involved are the string 
	  username, the string password, the boolean validUsername, and the boolean validPassword which 
	  represent the username, password, the validity of said username, and the validity of said password respectively.
	- If we successfully log in to the account it will print "Successful login attempt" 
	  and it will overwrite the currentUser field in the driver.
	- The only ways to make the code fail is to input:
		a) A username that does not match any usernames of the accounts in the account arraylist.
		b) A password that does not match the password of the account that shares the username 
		   that you are attempting to log in as.


Test for Log in method - Logging in as an Admin:
	- Ensures that we can log in to an existing admin account. The variables/objects involved are the string 
	  username, the string password, the boolean validUsername, and the boolean validPassword which 
	  represent the username, password, the validity of said username, and the validity of said password respectively.
	- If we successfully log in to the account it will print "Successful login attempt" 
	  and it will overwrite the currentUser field in the driver.
	- The only ways to make the code fail is to input:
		a) A username that does not match any usernames of the account in the account arraylist.
		b) A password that does not match the password of the account that shares the username 
		   that you are attempting to log in as.


Test for method that processes bids - Bid smaller than sales price:
	- Ensures that we cannot place a bid that is invalid. The variables/objects involved are the integer 
	  auctionIndex, the Auction auction, the double value, and the Bid b which 
	  represent the index of the auction the bid is to be placed on, the auction the bid is placed on,
	  the amount of money to be placed on the bid, and the bid object itself.
	- If we successfully place the bid it will print out "*SYSTEM MESSAGE: Processing Bid: " followed by 
	  a summary of the bid which includes the item name, the customer username, the bid amount, and the auction id;
	  the program will then add the bid to to the arraylist activeBids in the customers field as well as push it 
	  into the stack of bids in the auction.
	- The only ways to make the bid invalid or the code to fail is to input:
		a) An amount of money smaller than the sales price
		b) An amount of money between the sales price and the sales price plus an increment
		c) An amount of money between the current highest bid and the current highest bid plus an increment
		d) A different type of data than was expected EX: a string when it expected a double


Test for method that processes bids - Bid smaller than highest bid:
	- Ensures that we can place a bid that is smaller than the highest bid. The variables/objects involved are the integer 
	  auctionIndex, the Auction auction, the double value, and the Bid b which 
	  represent the index of the auction the bid is to be placed on, the auction the bid is placed on,
	  the amount of money to be placed on the bid, and the bid object itself.
	- If we successfully place the bid it will print out "*SYSTEM MESSAGE: Processing Bid: " followed by 
	  a summary of the bid which includes the item name, the customer username, the bid amount, and the auction id;
	  the program will then add the bid to to the arraylist activeBids in the customers field as well as push it 
	  into the stack of bids in the auction. Finally it will change the current sales price to the bid that was just placed plus an increment.
	- The only ways to make the bid invalid or the code to fail is to input:
		a) An amount of money smaller than the sales price
		b) An amount of money between the sales price and the sales price plus an increment
		c) An amount of money between the current highest bid and the current highest bid plus an increment
		d) A different type of data than was expected EX: a string when it expected a double


Test for method that processes bids - Bid higher than highest bid:
	- Ensures that we can place a bid that is higher than the current highest bid. The variables/objects involved are the integer 
	  auctionIndex, the Auction auction, the double value, and the Bid b which 
	  represent the index of the auction the bid is to be placed on, the auction the bid is placed on,
	  the amount of money to be placed on the bid, and the bid object itself.
	- If we successfully place the bid it will print out "*SYSTEM MESSAGE: Processing Bid: " followed by 
	  a summary of the bid which includes the item name, the customer username, the bid amount, and the auction id;
	  the program will then add the bid to to the arraylist activeBids in the customers field as well as push it 
	  into the stack of bids in the auction. Finally it will change the current sales price to the previous highest bid plus an increment then change 
	  the current highest bid to the bid that was just placed.
	- The only ways to make the bid invalid or the code to fail is to input:
		a) An amount of money smaller than the sales price
		b) An amount of money between the sales price and the sales price plus an increment
		c) An amount of money between the current highest bid and the current highest bid plus an increment
		d) A different type of data than was expected EX: a string when it expected a double
