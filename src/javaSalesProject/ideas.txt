Login system
	- To maximize the realism, a text file should be created that contains the login information regarding a specific account.
	  Upon each login attempt this text file should be opened and used to verify the credentials for a given login attempt
	  	- Maybe search through this file scanning each line for the username the user provided.
	  	  If the given username is found, proceed with comparing the password associated with that username.
		- Until a GUI is developed, we have to handle credential input one piece at a time. That is, we ask 
		  for a username, scan the text file for an account that has that username and then once it is proven that
		  that username is associated with an existing account we can ask the user for a password. From that point, verification
		  is easy because we are literally just comparing what the user inputted to what is present in the password field in the 
		  text file and if they match we allow the user entry.
		- This would get us accustomed to working with file I/O and I believe could help all three of us tremendously
		- We must include a way to overwrite this text file with new information, "log in as new user" is a menu option.
		- Transaction history that is account specific
		- Make sure if you enter a basic user account's credentials at the admin's login prompt it doesn't authenticate the standard user
			- In the text file 
		- Something that determines when a user account already exists so we don't create duplicate user/admin accounts
		- Put limits on the password creation that stops a user from creating a password that contains certain characters (i.e. |,~)
		  so we can use those character as delimiters in the text file
		- Have to sign in as an admin to create/delete accounts other than your own
		- Upon the deletion of an account, the user must supply a password to verify that the correct account is
		  being deleted (account of the user that is currently logged in)
		- If there is nothing in the ArrayList of accounts (if some knucklehead deletes everything in there) it must be populated
		  with an initial account with default credentials so that the program can be used to create another account
		  
	- How to keep track of who is currently logged in?
		- There must be a variable that holds the account object (customer/admin) that is currently logged in
		- This will ensure there can only be one account active at any one time
		
Bidders
	- Just like the customer class, fields to this one include the max bid, name, etc. 
	

Bids
	- Timestamping each bid for the purpose of record keeping
	- "Winnning bids" refer to the bids that won the auction, the bid that was submitted that resulted in that bid's 
	  customer winning the auction 
	- "Active bids" are part of an active and ongoing auction. They refer to bids that are still relevant in a live
  	  auction that has not yet finished
	
	
Auctions
	- Auctions are only open from 9 to 5, so bids placed outside of those hours get stored for backlogging data
	- Auctions only accept bids from a specified start time and the specified end time 
	  There exist some classes that are capable of taking the time from your local machine and producing input based on that


Menu items that still don't work:
	
	Main Menu (for Admin/Customer/logged out)
	- Process backlogged data
	
	Admin Options Menu
	- Choose an ongoing auction and check the bidding history
	- List information about completed auctions
	- Summary data of winning bids

	Customer Options Menu
	- Pay for an item that I won

Additional menu options
	
	Customer Options Menu
	- Implement a balance for each account
	- menu option that allows each customer to make a deposit on their account balance
	  (We can then tie the "pay for an item that I won" option to this account balance)

	Clay 2/19/21
	
	- Added a class for strictly testing/debugging methods called testing. This will get deleted when we submit our assignment
	- Added constructors to the account, customer, and admin methods for creating account when read in from a file (needed to include ID)
	- Adjusted the readWriteAccounts class to match the addition of the ID field
	- Wrote and tested a CreateAccount class that will create admin and customer accounts
	- Added an input methods class for methods we will commonly use to get input from the user
	- Added an InvalidInputException class for reasons we have already discussed
	- Included a simple menu in main to test the creation of accounts and outputting/inputting them from a file

	Kevin 2/25/21
	
	- Added two new classes, AdminOptions and CustomerOptions, to hold the if construct that governs the admin and the customer menus
	- Made the driver incorporate the two new classes so that the menus transition into and out of one another in logical way
	- Cleaned up the driver, and removing the methods that were deprecated and meant for a previous version of the program and 
	  labeling the methods that are still relevant and in use.
	- Changed the way the menus print, each menu now has a header for easier distinguishing
	- Added the methods customerSubMenu and adminSubMenu which acts an in-between for the main menu and the admin/customer menu.
	  This menu asks the user if he wants to log in as a new account or an existing one

	  - Developed more of the framework for the Bid, Auction, and Customer class in preparation for future
	    communication between those types

	  Kevin 3/4/21
	
 	  - Added a list of items to the driver in the loadItems() method. 
 	  - Adjusted the main menu so that there are now 6 options - one of them is the loadItemData option
	____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
	Clay 3/4/21
	
	- Changed nextNum in the item class to static (all items had an id of 100 before)
	
	- Changed the toString of the item class to print the price in currency format
	
	- Moved menuClay to the testing class
	
	- Adjust getUsername and getPassword in createAccount to more efficiently validate input
	
	- Added (yes or no) to a few existing printlns
	
	- Added a line to some of kevins if statements
	
	- Adjusted the login method in the account validation class to ask the user if they would like to try 
	  a different username/password after an invalid entry is made. Did this to avoid the situation where a 
	  user forgets username/password and is stuck in an infinite loop of guessing.
		
	- Split menuUserLoggedIn into two sepearate menus in the driver. One for admin logged in and one for customer logged in
	
	- Utilized one method to validate input for all of the menu selections in the menu class. The method that does this is in the InputMethods class
	
	- Changed yesNoToBool in the InputMethods class so that the method prints the question the first time.

	- Added the Queue and Stack classes 
	- Added the throw error line when user tries to pop from an empty stack or dequeue from an empty cue
	  and fixed a bug in which the prev field of each Node would never get overwritten
	- Also made Queue class and the Stack class generic
